#### Customer Statement of Requirement. ####


	As a result of several interview that we had with our Customer. Not just one of them, we had extra interviews with other health care environments. We had interviews with these places listed as follows.


1.	Hakim sanayee Clinic
2.	Panjtan Al Aba
3.	Jebraiel Governmental Hospital.
4.	Hashemi Medical Store.
5.	Mohammadi Medical Store.
6.	Jakan Medical Store.
7.	Nazary Medical Store.
8.	Al-berouni Private Hospital.
9.	Khalid Medical Store.    


They were talking about their problems they had with the environment system.

The system that is being used by people is mostly just papers and pen.    
	There is several requirements that should be solved.    

Such as:


If a patients lost his or her description. Patients has no backup how doctors should know, which kind of drugs she has been using. And it was a lot of time consuming and also they must pay money for every paper that they were using for their patients. It was so difficult for them if they were moved from one place to another place to move all the records of their patients if they had some.

And it can be easily stolen. Could be damaged soon, burned or being useless, and holds place. And also difficult to take care of.


There was a man saying that for every dose that we were selling we must give a receipt for the customer. And it’s a bit time consuming work.


 And more than that it was difficult for a guy to sit on cash draws and count every person’s bill, it’s a bit annoying work for some people. They don’t like too much counting.	return
Several customers saying that, the system can help us with this problem.


With counting, time serving, no more loss of records, it helps us to be more confident, more reliable, and accurate. A customer said to us, about his problem facing with his work on medical was the fake or not real doses that they had in his medical store, and had the real one, if you could build us with a system that can distinguish between this doses. We’ll be so grateful.	 
Another customer was talking about problem with the counting of his bill, he said that we have a lot of patients and I don’t have enough time to calculate the bill for them, most of the time I make mistakes in calculating them. And this is a loss of money for me.


Another problem was with the record of their patients, they didn’t have a record from their patients.


If you survey the clinical laboratories, you wouldn’t find one record.


Because of that they couldn’t find the real number of people affected by a disease in a country.
Also you couldn’t’ have access the records from another place, and watch for your records and drugs that have been used by patient. If a patient wants to get to his or her records from another place to show to another doctor for his or her treatment she couldn’t if she lost his/her record that was with him/her. 
You could access your records from another treatment site and get the information about your patients and be able to advise them some treatments or take a result.


In reality it had two kind of problem first one was with the hospital or Medical stores.


The second one was with the patients.


First one is quite difficult to diagnose but it’s possible to diagnose it.


For your medical store, hospitals or another health care agencies. It’s good to know about your patients everything, it helps doctors to take a better result from the treatments. Or can change the treatment process if it’s not working well. Or have access synchronously several patients’ records if needed.	
Or if you want to know the number of affected people by a disease at some particular time. You must serve a lot of time to calculate your patients if you have the whole record of your patients if you don’t lost any if it’s usable at all.	

	
As a patients perspective we can say that client must have a whole record of his/her self in his/her hands everywhere he/she wants to go for treatment. If he/she doesn’t lost some. If he can save for him/herself. If he/she can have their record after an accident.


Customer said to us: your system can help us with all of the problem, also make the patients free of their records. And no more caution about their records and reliability of the system.

Can solve most of the patient’s problem.    


Our proposed management system and design is such that it will give the report of all patients, patient services, making decision and solution of your daily problem, such as better services to people, and also stock reporting link, getting information about your everyday drug sales, visited doctors, descriptions, personnel reporting, Operation treatments, patients payment, drug repository reporting in time scale of daily, monthly, yearly reporting. On the other hand also laboratory reporting give the information like result reporting and time of report. In patients information you are able to get the all information about your patients including dates and times he/she arrived. It’s also capable of securing by restricting access to the data in your database. In operation treatment, the software gives description of your Operations, available rooms, which doctor is in charge, patient’s payment and what kind of operation they had at what time.

 


According to our interview that we had with Mr. Saedi and visiting from Qods clinic. Khadhra team understood the requirements to be as such:

 *Stockholders and Goals*

Several people are involved in our system. Such as:
1.	Manager of clinic or Admin: manager of admin can manage and supervise all subsystem and department.
2.	Druggist: druggist just works with drug store subsystem and enters the name of sold drugs and some information about prescription.
3.	Laboratory personal: they just work with laboratory subsystem and should enter the result of tests into system to record and printing the result sheet of test.
4.	Receptionist: receptionist receives the patients and registers them into system and has interaction with operation room, parturition department and laboratory department.
5.	Bar Code Reader: this device use in drug store to make easier the selling.
6.	Scanner and Camera: these devices used in office to enter personal`s photo into system to complete their identity form. 
7.	Printer: this device use in office to print the information of system if it necessary, in reception to print the receipts and in laboratory department to print the result sheet.
	
*SubSystem1:*
 
Reception is responsible for the printing the receipt for every patient who wants to visit doctor. Take the full description of the patient and print a receipt for the patient. This receipt will give the patient authority to visit the doctor otherwise the patient will not be able to visit doctor.
 
The subsystem1 can hold this kind for information in system. Save it, and the result will be a print and the patients will be added to the system, if the patients is new the record is added, if the patient had come several time before the old receipt is printed for the patient and a  bar show that he/she how many time has visited here. The records can be deleted from the system. The subsystem does the printing also.

Except for Emergency Patients they will be able to get the receipt later.
 


*SubSystem2:*

Medical or Drug /Store : is responsible for adding new dose to the system and entering new rates to doses and can edit the rate and name of the medicines in Drug store. If medicine is not available in store they can note it as not available in store. Druggist values to add more doses in system and print it.    

Can view and edit the patient’s records.
 
Subsystem2 is doing the job of saving all the medicines in system and storing and saving and choosing it’s the right person that access to the system, by showing the menu for accessing user name and password.
 
Printing, deleting, saving, or editing, can be applied to the records.
 

*SubSystem3:*

Laboratory: this guy is responsible for the testing to laboratory and adding the result of the tests to the system. After it’s added to the system it can be viewed and be able to be edited, deleted and printed.

The system does all the first time temporary saving and user can choose to save or not to.


*SubSystem4:*
 
Operation room: this system is designed for the operation room.
 
Every result of laboratory test and medicine that the patients has used before is reported to the operation room. The operation when the operation is complete.
The result can be added to the patient link that shows that the patient is been to Operation Theater. 

*subSystem5:* 

parturition it’s for the patients about the pregnancy and other related disease.

	The patients must be listed here, according to their sickness type that the patient has.


SubSystem6: Office

	Office is for managing all the aspect of Hospital. This part is for manager and Administrators,
Who has the ability to all of the resources in hospital? To manage it.


Traceability Matrix: shows the mathematical calculation of the project. Such as:

1.	When patients came, after the checking they must be pay for those.
2.	Doctors, nurses, and workers want salary in-order to work.

Salary of doctors per month =   


Salary of nurses per month =    


Salary of worker per month =	
                       
Count all of them.

Check out for patients if it reaches to particular point. Count them with percentages. How 
		Scenario: checkout for patients if the patient is under 40 than
		Count all the money got from patients, find the defined percentage return the result.	return
		Ex: there is 40 patients every patient has purchased medicine and the total of them is 90000 if a doctor takes percentages than assume he’s taking 5% of all    


			90000 = 100    


			X  =  5             

			x  = 4500    


That is done.


Check out for every person and check for the occupation: doctor, nurse, and worker. Count all the salary of them and give the output as a total amount of payment. And take notice if occupation is doctor count all the doctors, nurses, workers. Show the total amount of the salary of doctors, workers, nurses and display it. Check if a doctor has took the salary of every month. If not then add the previous salary to this salary and give the result.


	For the medical: take every medicine’s rate, and the dose percentage check out how many of this kind has been sold, if n kind than n * rate = total amount. 	

If the company want the profit. Than all amount of money the Clinic got it should be minuses from the amount of money the company has to spend.

Or has given to Companies that the hospital gets medicines from.
We normally have two kinds of Spends 


1.	Constant
    
2. 	Dynamics

Constants: is constant like the bills, Cars etc.	


Dynamics: are not possible to assume maybe some time a lot maybe some time very less.
  
			
		
			
*Fully Dressed Description:* 

I start here with the User manual how he/she enters to the System. I’ll not cover all of them here because it’ll be so long to.


	First of all when the application opens, a window opens than it asks for user name and password. And then click ok the user is logged in.


After it recognize that the user is from which part he’s medical store, opt theater, or office or from the other part. That user only access on his own part not the others the other parts will be disabled for that user.

 
How a reception can add new patients:

 
When the come in the receptionist takes his/her full specification. The patient decides to go where. Opt, visit doctor, or parturition or laboratory. And the amount of money he/she should pay for the receipt. After the patient decide to go where the receipt will be printed. By clicking the print button.
I have covered the two of them. There is several more. 


System Sequence diagram: draw a system sequence diagram selected above.
    
                     Main page                                 login

this lines are not showing the inheritance it show the sections.


RP                 Lbt                     Office 	       Md stre		      prtn                      opt 


Add new Patients                                    sell                 edit                add

RP = receptionist              prtn = parturition	return
Lbt =  Laboratory              opt = operation Theater	return
Md stre = Medical store  	return 
	return
User interface specification:

1.	How user logs in:
 
2.	First a dialog opens, to choose who is he/she if, it selects and types his/her name than the password.

3.	Than the main page will open, the places that the reception can access will be enabled to work, the other part that he/she doesn’t have access will be disabled, for example: receptionist doesn’t have access to the Operation Theater. You would see some more information around on picture. Medical(1)


4.	The receptionist wants to add a new patient to the database. Fill in the blanks full description of patient. There is several choice that a patient can make reserve for timing or go to parturition, visit doctor, and Operation Theater.

5.	After that receipt is printed for that patient. With the description of patient.

All pictures all included with the document. You can see all of them.

		On our model that the customer wants, several reports must be printed. 


**Part3:**

*Domain Model:*

 Our work domain model is as follows:
	
Head of the Hospital is one person, after his supervisors.1 for management and one for all medical, as shown on picture it’s divided as shown on the picture you can zoom it if it’s not possible to see.
