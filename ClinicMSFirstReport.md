<p>
**a. Problem statement** 
<p/>

They were talking about their problems they had with their system. The system that is being used by people is mostly just papers and pen. There are several requirements that should be solved. Such as:
<p/>

<p>
If a patient lose his or her description, patients has no backup, how doctors should know which kind of drugs she/he has been using and it waste a lot of time and also they must pay money for every paper that they were using for their patients. It is so difficult for them. They saying that for everything that we sell we must give a receipt for the customer. And it’s a bit time consuming work. Several customers say that your system can help us about this problem. It helps us to be more confident, more reliable, and accurate. With this system we can manage our clinic in different parts and departments. In drugstore with this system we can enter the drug name and numbers of drugs and system calculates and save the information in database. It helps us to manage and organize the salaries the shift of personals. A big problem was that we did not have any record of our patients. If you survey the clinical laboratories, you wouldn’t find one record in past but with this system we will have a good back up of our records and data. According to the reliable database that they use it will be reliable. They couldn’t find the real number of people affected by a disease in duration of our service. But now we have data and the system will show the incoming and the patients that served with us by graphs. Also now officer can control and check other subsystems (all subsystems) record, status of beds that how many are reserved and by whom, situation in laboratory that how many patients came to laboratory and how much money we earn, about ambulances, appointments of doctors and accounting from office by this system. Customer said, your system can help us with the entire problem, also make the patients free of their records. And no more caution about their records and reliability of the system can solve most of us and our patient’s problem.
<p/>
<p>
We are honor that our proposed management system and design is such that it will give the report of all patients, patient services, making decision and solution of your daily problem, such as better services to people, and also stock reporting link, getting information about your everyday drug sales, visited doctors, descriptions, personnel reporting, Operation treatments, patients payment, drug repository reporting in time scale of daily, monthly, yearly reporting. On the other hand also laboratory reporting give the information like result reporting and time of report. In patients information you are able to get the all information about your patients including dates and times he/she arrived. It’s also capable of securing by restricting access to the data in your database. In operation treatment, the software gives description of your Operations, available rooms, which doctor is in charge, patient’s payment and what kind of operation they had at what time.
